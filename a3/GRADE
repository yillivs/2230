`make flash` compiles and flashes `signal.c`

mode 1 works if red is attached to P2.1, but this is due to timer/signal on that pin, not execution loop.

PORT1_VECTOR is triggered when the button is pressed. it should change modes but probably shouldn't change P1OUT/P2OUT

it looks like 
    P1.0 is supposed to be for red
    P1.1 is supposed to be for green, and
    P2.2 is supposed to be for blue
    
timer/signal successfully configured on P2.1

good comments

no modes operate correctly

TimerA interrupt handler is missing

6/20
